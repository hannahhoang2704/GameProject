# Flight game project

Project related to flight game database and CO2 consumption.


<strong>General idea and the purpose of the game </strong>

The aim of the single-player Flight Simulator Game project is to produce an entertaining game where the player gets to use an airplane to fly from a selected airport to Rovaniemi and use as little CO2 consumption as possible. It is a text baseline and interactive game, allowing users to use the keyboard to engage throughout the game. Based on players’ inputs the program will generate different outcomes. 
 
The program begins with a short story. The purpose of the storyline is to raise the interest of the player in the game. The story tells that people who either do or do not believe in Santa Claus once a year take a plane to fly to Rovaniemi to either pull Santa’s beard or hug him. To meet Santa Claus, players need to fly through 5 stops and keep the CO2 consumption during the trip as low as possible.  

In the beginning of the game, to fly to the first destination, the player has consumed CO2 of 5000 units, per default. In order to win the game, he needs to pass through 5 stops within a budget of 10 000 CO2 units. Once the player’s CO2 score is equal or over 10 000 units, the game is over.

In every destination, the player needs to answer a question related to environment and sustainability. Depending on his answer, the weather in the game will change and affect CO2 score. If the answer is correct, his CO2 consumption will be deducted and vice versa.
